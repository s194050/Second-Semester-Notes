* What is a MUD game?
    MUD stands for Multi-User Dungeon, and is a type of online game in which multiple players interact with each other in a virtual world. Players explore, battle monsters, complete quests, and socialize with each other. MUDs are similar to MMORPGs (massively multiplayer online role-playing games) but tend to be less graphically intensive and more text-based.

* Peer 2 Peer network for MUD game
    Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networks are decentralized networks where each node is both a client and a server. Data is shared between nodes on the network, without the need for a central server. The nodes are usually computers, but can also include phones, tablets and other devices. This makes P2P networks highly resilient because if any single node fails, the network can still function as long as there are other nodes to share data with.


# UML 
* What is UML 
    UML (Unified Modeling Language) is a graphical language used to create visual models of software systems. It is used to design, visualize, and document the components of a system and how they interact with each other. UML diagrams are composed of symbols and notations that represent the structure and behavior of a system, allowing developers to understand a system more easily.

* Best approach in creating a class diagram
    When creating a class diagram, the best approach is to start by identifying the classes and objects that will be included in the system. Then, identify the relationships between these classes and objects. Finally, decide on any necessary attributes or methods for each class or object. It is also important to consider design patterns that may be applicable for the system being modeled.

* Design by Contract 
    Design by contract is a method of software development which formalizes the relationship between the client and supplier by specifying clearly and precisely the requirements of each part of the contract. The software developer and client agree on certain conditions that must be met in order for the software to be accepted. This includes stipulations regarding quality, performance, delivery, and other factors. The idea behind design by contract is to create a framework for ensuring that both parties understand their roles and responsibilities before any development begins. This helps to ensure that both parties are satisfied with the end product, reducing potential conflict and making it easier for future updates and modifications.

* What is the OCL (object constrained language) ?
    Object Constraint Language (OCL) is an expression language used to define constraints on object models expressed using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). OCL was originally developed by IBM in the 1990s and is now an ISO standard. It is commonly used to specify constraints on software designs and to check that designs meet the specified requirements. OCL allows developers to express simple or complex rules about the objects in a model, such as ensuring that an attribute is never left empty or that a relationship only has certain allowed values. OCL also provides a way of testing that objects comply with the constraints, by performing a consistency check.

*  UML metamodel is not used. Essentially is a class diagram of a class diagram.

* Interconnection between the different UML diagrams

* A use sequence diagram works as a sanity check on whether the class diagram and final-state-machine diagram are correct or not.
	* Furthermore the state-machine also shows whether the sequence diagram is correct on input/output

* Best way to approach CRC Cards 
	 The best way to approach creating CRC cards is to first identify the objects, classes, and relationships that exist in the system. Then create a card for each object or class, listing its responsibilities and its collaborations with other classes. Finally, review the cards to identify any necessary changes or additions that need to be made to ensure all relationships are accurately represented.

* Model Driven design 
	   Model Driven design is a software engineering approach that focuses on creating and exploiting domain models, which are abstract representations of the knowledge and activities that govern a particular application domain. The model driven design process typically involves the use of modeling languages, such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), to create models of the domain. These models are then used to generate code that can be deployed in applications. Model Driven design enables developers to quickly and effectively create applications by focusing on the core aspects of the problem domain, rather than on the technical details of implementation. This approach also allows for rapid prototyping and iteration, allowing developers to quickly test different ideas without having to write new code from scratch each time.
