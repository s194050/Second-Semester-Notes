Ping - Ping messages are sent between all the nodes including D. Furthermore a Query will also be sent until node D, where it will respond with Queryhit.

It would have a very large overhead, as the amount of peers that might need to be avoided, can be massive if they are all unreliable and untrustworthy.

Firstly the biggest issue, would be the amount of peers disconnecting all the time. As objects are tracked by nodes. Furthermore every time a node joins or leaves the routing tables must be updated, as such a system with high churn should not be using DHT.
