*  Trusted Computing
	* Defacto Security
	* Theft Protection
	* Enhanced Local Protection
	* Decentralisation - One of the most important parts of trusted computing

* Challenges with Centralisation
	* Single point of failure
	* Communication overhead
	* Data leaks

* Trust
	* Trust - acting according to expectation
	* Trustworthiness - Acting in a predictable behaviour

* Roots of Trust (RoT)
	* If a RoT trusts another entitity it forms an Chain of Trust
	* The TPM is a root of trust
	* It stores the measurement algorithm - that is used to verify for tampering

* TPM
	* 24 Volatile registers
		* Every register is a hash chain of measurements
		* These cannot be altered
	* Each area of the hardware represents a register
