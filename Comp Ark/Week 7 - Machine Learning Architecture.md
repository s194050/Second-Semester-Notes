* Convolutional Layer
	* Consists of channels
		* As an example for images, there are three channels due to RGB.
	* What is an Convolutional kernel?
		* A convolutional kernel (also known as a convolutional filter or convolution matrix) is a small matrix used to detect specific patterns or features in an image. It is the building block of a convolutional neural network (CNN). It is used to detect various features such as edges, corners, etc. in an image.


* Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
	* What is an ASIC? 
		* An ASIC, or Application Specific Integrated Circuit, is an integrated circuit (IC) custom-designed for a particular use, rather than general purpose use. ASICs are used in a wide variety of applications, including consumer electronics, communications equipment, and even aerospace engineering. They are faster and more power efficient than general-purpose ICs because they are designed to perform a single task, rather than multiple tasks.

* What is an domain specific architecture in machine learning? 
	* Domain-specific architectures in machine learning are models designed to solve problems in a specific domain, such as image classification, natural language processing, or recommender systems. These architectures are designed to take advantage of the specific characteristics of the domain and can be tailored to the type of data and the problem at hand. They are often highly optimized for a particular dataset or task and can provide superior performance compared to general-purpose architectures.

* What is an systolic array?
	* A systolic array is an arrangement of processors in a regular topology that performs a specific computation on data elements that are passed from one processor to the next. It is used to boost the performance of certain types of computations, such as matrix-vector multiplication and convolution, by allowing multiple processors to operate on the same data in parallel.
